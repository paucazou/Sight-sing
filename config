C
# other_scales (put the degree of the scale which will be used, e.g. V for the dominant scale in major, IV for the subdominant in major, vi for the relative minor, III for the relative major, 0 for no other scale)
0
# scales_balance (balance between main scale and the other. If balance is 50, main scale will represent about 50% of the notes, and the other 50% will be splitted equally between the other scales, e.g. 25/25 if they are two other scales)

# last_degrees (if any degree, just put a 0. You can put as many degrees as you want: IV,V,I for instance)
